This is the class site for the hackathon aimed at describing the basics of Object Oriented Programming through a challenge based approach:

- Today: workshop on Python.
- On Thursday you will be given a challenge that you (as a group) then have two days to solve.
    - You will get some feedback at the end of Thursday (possibly late into the
      evening)
    - Your final submission will be assessed at the end of Friday
